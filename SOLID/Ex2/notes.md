The Problem: Multiple Responsibilities in One Method
Originally, the CafeteriaSystem.checkout method was a Main Method that handled everything. If we needed to change one small detail, we had to modify the entire core logic.
Hard-coded Logic: The tax and discount rules were written as if-else blocks inside the class.
Tight Coupling: The system was locked into using FileStore for saving and a specific format for printing.
Fragile Code: Changing the invoice layout meant breaking the calculation logic because they were mixed together.

Our Approach: Decoupling via Strategy & Interfaces
We applied the Single Responsibility Principle to break the method apart:
TaxCalculator & DiscountCalculator Interfaces: We moved the rules out of the system. Now, the rules are separate objects passed into the method.
InvoicePrinter Class: We moved all StringBuilder and String.format logic to this dedicated class.
InvoiceStore Interface: We created an abstraction so the system does not know where it is saving (Database, File, or Memory).
InvoiceData DTO: We created a simple data holder to carry the calculated results from the math section to the printing section.

Lets take an example of Adding a New DiscountType
The Old Way:
To add a new discount, type or change in existing we would have to open DiscountRules.java and modify a long if-else chain. If we made a typo, we might break the "Student" discount by accident.
The New Way:
We create a brand new class called New DiscountCalculator that implements the DiscountCalculator interface.
write the logic only for staff in that new file.
In Main.java, we have to just pass this new object into the checkout method.
Hence , We added a feature without changing any existing code in CafeteriaSystem or StudentDiscountCalculator.
