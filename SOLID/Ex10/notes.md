The Problem
In the existing code the TransportBookingService was tightly coupled with its own dependencies like it was dependent on concrete classes like DistanceCalculator DriverAllocator and PaymentGateway directly so suppose if we have to change the Payment Gateway for a different provider, we had to manually open and modify the TransportBookingService.java file. Since highlevelmodule like BookingService is dependent on low level modules like DistanceCalculator etc, hence it is violation DIP.

Our Approach: Dependency Injection
To solve this, we can inverted the control of the application by following these steps:

We created IDistanceCalculator, IDriverAllocator, and IPaymentGateway. Now our existing classes will depend on these interface.
The TransportBookingService no longer creates its own tools. It will ask for them using interfaces in constructor hence DIP is not violated because now both highlevel and lowlevel modules are dependent on abstraction.
Now In Main.java, we now instantiate the concrete versions (like DistanceCalculator) and inject them into the pipeline.

Example -> 
So initiallly to change paymentgateway to different provider we will have to change the PayemntGateway from Service class hence reducing abstraction
But in the new way we can create a new provider which will implement the existing PaymentGateway interface and since service class dont depend on concrete class so we will not have to change anything in service class
We can directly go to Main class and create a new Payment provider and inject it in service class.
