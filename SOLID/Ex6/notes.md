The Problem: Unpredictable Subclasses
Originally, the subclasses were breaking the rules of the base class:
The WhatsAppSender would crash if a phone number didn't start with + even though the base NotificationSender didn't warn the caller about this.
EmailSender was silently changing the data (cutting off text), which is a hidden behavior that changes the meaning of the message and in SMSSender subject was ignores.
Because of these  the Main class had to use a try-catch block just for WhatsApp, meaning it couldn't treat all senders the same way and it become hard to swap between senders

Our Approach:
To solve this, we strengthened the base class and ensured all children follow the same behavior:
We ensured that common issues (like null notifications) are handled in the base class before the specific senders even touch them.
Instead of crashing, the WhatsAppSender should either accept the input or the base class should provide a way to check if a notification is valid for that channel.
We ensured that swapping between senders doesn't lead to unexpected crashes or corrupted data.

Lets take example
Suppose if we add a SlackSender, it might have had its own unique rule . The developer would have to go to Main.java and add a new try-catch block just for Slack, because they wouldn't know if it would crash or not and it will be complex to swap slacksender with other senders but in the New Way When we add SlackSender it will be implementing the NotificationSender interface hence, it follows the same contracts as other senders. It benefits from the null checks and sanitization already in the parent class.
We can add the SlackSender to your list of notification tools, and the Main class will work perfectly without needing any new if-else or try-catch blocks and now we can also make a swap between different sender.
