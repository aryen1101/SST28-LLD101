The Problem: The Hard-Coded Chain
Originally, the EligibilityEngine was a single method filled with if-else blocks. This made the code rigid because any new rule required changing the engine itself, and fragile because all rules were tangled together. If we wanted to change the CGR threshold from 8.0 to 7.5, we had to find and edit the value directly inside the EligibilityEngine.java.

Our Approach: Rule Abstraction
To solve this, we applied the Strategy Pattern to separate the Checking Logic from the Engine Execution.
EligibilityRule (Interface): We created a shared contract. Now, the engine doesn't need to know what it is checking; it only knows that every rule has a .check() method.
Specialized Classes: We created CGRRule, AttendanceRule, CreditsRule, and DisciplinaryRule. Each class has only one reason to change, satisfying the Single Responsibility Principle.
The List Injection: In Main.java, we create a List of Rules and pass it into the engine. This means the engine is now a Coordinator that simply loops through whatever rules you give it.

Lets take an example -> 
To add a rule that students must have zero F grade, we would have to open EligibilityEngine.java, find the middle of the evaluation method, and insert a new if-else block. One small mistake could break the existing attendance or CGR checks.

The New Way:
Create a New File: Write a BacklogRule.java that implements the EligibilityRule interface.
In Main.java, we can add new BacklogRule() to the list of rules.
Hence we added the feature without touching a single line of code in the EligibilityEngine or the other rule classes. This is the Open-Closed Principle in action—the engine is closed for changes but open for new rules.
